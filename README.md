## 1. Introduction

The Daily Transactions Management System is designed to streamline the recording and management of financial transactions for agents. This web-based application enables agents to efficiently process money transfers and withdrawals, while simultaneously sending SMS notifications to customers to confirm the successful completion of their transactions. This project leverages an SMS API, which can be integrated with any telecom provider's API of your choice.

### Key Features:
- **Transaction Management**: Add, update, and delete both deposit and withdrawal transactions.
- **SMS Notifications**: Automatic SMS notifications sent to customers after each transaction (requires an SMS API).
- **Real-time Analytics**: Analytics for transactions available in daily, weekly, monthly, annual, and lifetime intervals.

This system is targeted at financial agents and small businesses, particularly in East and Central Africa, that handle daily transactions. Existing methods for transaction tracking are often manual, prone to errors, and can lead to delays and miscommunication. Furthermore, customers often do not receive timely updates on their transactions, which can cause dissatisfaction. The system also aims to address inventory management challenges faced by agents in handling products and sales.
