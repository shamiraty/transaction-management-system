# Daily Transactions Management System

## 1. Introduction
The Daily Transactions Management System is designed to facilitate the recording and management of financial transactions conducted by agents. This web-based application enables agents to efficiently handle money transfers and withdrawals, while simultaneously sending SMS notifications to customers to confirm the completion of their transactions. This project uses an SMS API, but you must use your own SMS API provided by the telecom company. This system aims to enhance user experience by providing real-time updates and reliable transaction records.

## 2. Problem Statement
The target audience for this project includes financial agents, especially in Africa, who handle daily transactions and their customers who expect timely and accurate information about their financial activities. The existing methods for tracking transactions are often manual and prone to errors, leading to delays and miscommunication. Additionally, customers frequently lack immediate updates on their transaction statuses, which can lead to dissatisfaction and distrust in financial services.

## 3. Importance of Project
The importance of this project cannot be overstated. By automating the recording of transactions and integrating an SMS notification system, this application addresses critical issues in transaction management, including:
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time agents spend on manual entry and follow-ups.
- **Accuracy**: Minimizes the risk of human error in transaction records.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Provides customers with immediate feedback, improving their trust and engagement with the service.
- **Data Security**: Protects sensitive transaction data through secure storage and access protocols.

## 4. Main Objective
The main objective of the Daily Transactions Management System is to develop a comprehensive web application that:
- Accurately records daily financial transactions performed by agents (both sending money and withdrawals).
- Sends immediate SMS notifications to customers to confirm the successful completion of their transactions.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for both agents and customers.

## 5. Specific Objectives
To achieve the main objective, the project includes the following specific goals:
- **User Interface Design**: Create an intuitive and responsive UI for agents to input transaction data effortlessly.
- **Transaction Handling**: Implement backend logic to handle transaction processing and storage securely.
- **SMS Integration**: Utilize a third-party SMS API to send real-time notifications to customers upon transaction completion.
- **Data Reporting**: Develop functionality for generating daily and monthly transaction reports to aid agents in tracking performance.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling and logging mechanisms for troubleshooting and maintaining system integrity.

## 6. Design Methodology
### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: 
  - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for rapid development and clean design.
- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML**: For structuring web pages.
  - **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.
  - **JavaScript**: For enhancing user interactions and functionalities.
- **Database**: 
  - **MySQL**: A relational database for storing transaction records and user data.
- **SMS Service**: 
  - A RESTful API for sending SMS notifications.

### Development Approach
- **Agile Methodology**: The project will follow an agile development approach, allowing for iterative progress and feedback from stakeholders.
- **MVC Architecture**: Utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns within the application, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.
- **Version Control**: Using Git for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.
